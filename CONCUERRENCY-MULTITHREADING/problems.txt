Beginner Problems:

1
Write a Python program that uses the threading module to create two threads that print "Hello, World!" concurrently.

2
Implement a program that uses two threads to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 in parallel and prints the result.

3
Create a Python script that demonstrates a race condition by having multiple threads increment a shared counter variable.

4
Write a program that uses multithreading to download multiple images from the internet concurrently and save them to disk.

5
Implement a simple producer-consumer scenario using threads, where one thread generates data, and another consumes it.

6
Create a program that uses threads to compute the factorial of a number in parallel.

7
Write a Python script that demonstrates thread synchronization using threading.Lock to prevent race conditions.

8
Implement a program that uses threads to perform matrix multiplication on two large matrices concurrently.

9
Create a Python script that uses threads to simulate a simple bank account with deposits and withdrawals.

10
Write a program that demonstrates thread priority by creating threads with different priority levels and observing their execution order.


Intermediate Problems:

1
Implement a Python program that uses the concurrent.futures module to parallelize a CPU-bound task, such as calculating Fibonacci numbers.

2
Create a program that uses the multiprocessing module to perform parallel processing on multiple CPU cores to speed up a task.

3
Write a Python script that demonstrates thread pooling using the ThreadPoolExecutor from the concurrent.futures module.

4
Implement a program that uses threads to perform web scraping concurrently on multiple web pages and gather data.

5
Create a Python script that uses the asyncio library to make asynchronous HTTP requests to multiple URLs and retrieve data.

6
Write a program that demonstrates inter-thread communication using a thread-safe queue to pass data between producer and consumer threads.

7
Implement a Python program that uses the asyncio library to create a simple chat server that handles multiple clients concurrently.

8
Create a program that uses a thread pool to process a batch of image files concurrently, such as resizing and watermarking.

9
Write a Python script that uses the concurrent.futures module to parallelize a task that involves reading and processing multiple files.

10
Implement a program that demonstrates thread coordination using semaphores to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded environment.
