"""
In Python list comprehensions are a concise way
to create lists in Python. They allow you to generate
a new list by applying an expression to each item in
an existing iterable (e.g., a list, tuple, or range)
and optionally filter the items based on a condition.
List comprehensions are a more compact and readable alternative
to using traditional for loops to create lists.
