Sure, here are beginner-level problems for each of the categories you mentioned:

Asyncio Problems for Beginners:

Async Sleep:
Write an asyncio program that prints "Hello, World!" after waiting for 3 seconds using asyncio.sleep().

Countdown Timer:
Create an asyncio program that counts down from 5 to 1 with a one-second delay between each count and then prints "Blast off!"

Fetch URLs Concurrently:
Write a program that fetches data from three different URLs concurrently using asyncio and asyncio.gather(). Print the lengths of the data received from each URL.

Event Loop Running:
Write an asyncio program that simulates rolling a die twice and prints the results. Ensure the event loop is correctly set up and run in the main() function.

Task Creation:
Define two coroutines, coroutine1() and coroutine2(). Create and run these coroutines as tasks using asyncio.create_task() and print "Task 1 completed!" and "Task 2 completed!" when they finish.

Concurrent Execution Problems for Beginners:

Parallel Sum:
Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using concurrent execution with two functions, each handling half of the numbers. Ensure they synchronize and print the final sum.

Concurrent Downloads:
Create a program that downloads three different images concurrently from the internet using Python's requests library. Save each image to a file with a unique name.

Multiple Threads:
Implement a Python program that uses multiple threads to print "Thread A" and "Thread B" alternatively for 10 iterations each.

Producer-Consumer Problem:
Simulate the producer-consumer problem using two functions: producer() and consumer(). The producer adds items to a shared queue, and the consumer removes items from the queue. Ensure proper synchronization.

Shared Counter:
Write a Python program that uses multiple threads to increment a shared counter variable by 1,000. Ensure that all threads properly update the counter without race conditions.

I/O Operations Problems for Beginners:

File Reading and Writing:
Create a program that reads a text file, modifies its content (e.g., converts all text to uppercase), and writes the modified content back to a new file.

Fetching URLs:
Write a program that fetches the content of three different web pages using the requests library and saves them to separate files.

Directory Listing:
Implement a script that lists all files and directories in a specified directory using the os module. Print the results to the console.

User Input and Output:
Create a simple command-line program that asks the user for their name and age, then prints a personalized greeting with their age.

Asynchronous File Download:
Modify a previous web scraping program to download multiple web pages concurrently using asyncio and aiohttp. Save each page to a file.

Event Loop Running Problems for Beginners:

Repeatedly Rolling a Die:
Write an asyncio program that simulates rolling a die every 2 seconds. Roll the die 5 times, printing the results each time, and then stop.

Timed Function Execution:
Create an asyncio program that runs a function every 1 second for a total of 5 times. Print a message on each invocation.

Tasks Problems for Beginners:

Task Coordination:
Define two coroutines: worker1() and worker2(). Create and run these coroutines as tasks. Ensure that worker2() starts only after worker1() finishes.

Task Wait:
Create three tasks that each simulate a different time-consuming operation (e.g., sleep for 3 seconds). Use await asyncio.wait() to wait for all tasks to complete and print a message when all tasks are done.

Coroutines Problems for Beginners:

Implement a Python program that uses multiple threads to print "Thread A" and "Thread B" alternatively for 10 iterations each.

Coroutine Chain:
Create three coroutines, coroutine1(), coroutine2(), and coroutine3(). Chain them together so that coroutine2() is called from coroutine1() and coroutine3() is called from coroutine2(). Print a message from each coroutine to verify the order of execution.

Exception Handling:
Write a coroutine that divides two numbers taken as input from the user. Handle the division by zero exception gracefully, printing an error message if it occurs.

Asyncio Methods Problems for Beginners:

asyncio.gather():
Define three coroutines, task1(), task2(), and task3(), each of which simulates a time-consuming operation. Use asyncio.gather() to run them concurrently and print a message when all tasks are completed.

asyncio.sleep():
Write a program that uses asyncio.sleep() to implement a simple timer. Prompt the user for a duration in seconds and then print a message after the specified time has passed.

asyncio.create_task():
Define a coroutine worker() that simulates a time-consuming task. Use asyncio.create_task() to create and run multiple instances of worker() as tasks. Print a message when each task completes.

asyncio.run():
Write a program that calculates the factorial of a number entered by the user using a recursive coroutine. Use asyncio.run() to execute the coroutine and print the result.

These problems cover a range of asyncio and concurrent programming concepts suitable for beginners to practice and understand asynchronous Python programming.
