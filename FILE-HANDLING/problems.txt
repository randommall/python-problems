Intermediate Problems:

1
Implement a program that reads a CSV file, performs some data analysis (e.g., calculating the average), and prints the results.

2
Write a Python script that reads a JSON file, extracts specific data from it, and stores it in another JSON file.

3
Create a program that reads a log file, extracts error messages, and writes them to a separate error log file.

4
Implement a program that recursively searches for files with a specific extension in a directory and its subdirectories.

5

6
Create a program that reads a binary file (e.g., an image or audio file) and displays information about its format.

7
Implement a program that compresses a text file using a compression algorithm and saves the compressed data to another file.

8
Write a Python script that reads a text file containing code and checks for syntax errors without executing the code.

9
Create a program that reads a configuration file (e.g., INI or YAML) and prints its contents.

10
