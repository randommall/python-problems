Beginner Problems:

1
Import the math module and use it to calculate
the square root of a given number in a file called square_1.py.
create another file called imported_1.py, import the square.py
 and use it to print the results.

2
write a program that that creates four functions; addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, and division.
create another file and import the functions, use the functions to run
arithmetic problems and print them

3
List Operations:
Write a Python script that imports the math module and defines a list of numbers.
 Use a list comprehension to calculate the square root of each number and store 
the results in a new list. Print the original list and the list of square roots.

4
Importing Variables:
Create a Python script that defines variables for your name, age, and location. 
Import these variables into another script and print a message using the imported
 variables to introduce yourself.

5
Dictionaries and Imports:
Define a dictionary with information about books, such as titles and authors.
 Save this dictionary in a file called books.py. In a new script, import the
 dictionary from books.py and use it to print details about a specific book.

6
Module-Based Data Processing:
Create a Python module named data_generator.py that contains a function to 
generate a list of 20 random numbers between 1 and 100. In a separate script, 
import the data_generator module and use the generated data to create two lists
 using list comprehensions: one with numbers less than 50 and another with numbers
 greater than or equal to 50. Print all three lists.

7
Importing Temperature Converter:
Write a Python script that imports a module named temperature_converter.py.
 This module contains functions to convert between Celsius and Fahrenheit
 temperatures. Use the imported module to convert a user-input temperature 
in one unit to the other. Ensure that error handling for invalid input is
 handled within the temperature_converter module.

8
Enhancing User Profiles:
Define a dictionary that represents a user's profile with keys for name, age,
 email, and city. Create a Python module named user_profile.py that contains a 
function to import the user's profile. In a separate script, import the
 user_profile module, ask the user for additional information like a phone
 number, and update the dictionary with the new data. Finally, print the updated
 profile.

9
Importing Number Guessing Game:
Create a Python script that imports a module named number_game.py. This 
module generates a random number between 1 and 100 and implements a guessing
 game. Import the module and use it to play the guessing game, tracking the 
number of attempts and providing hints to the user. When the user guesses
 correctly, print the number of attempts and the guessed number.
